#Description
Are you tired of having to server all you videos out of public?
Want a simple solution that keeps your videos private but is super easy
to use?

token-auth-video-server is your solution. 
token-auth-video-server is a simple sinatra application and client that
allows you to render videos that are protected by an auth token.

#Usage
Add the following line to your Gemfile:

``` gem 'token-auth-video-server', :git => "git://github.com/rweald/token-auth-video-server.git" ```

If you only want to require the client library in your rails app simply
add ``` :require => "token-auth-video-server/client" ``` to the above
line. 

To generate an auth token that will be valid for 3 mins simply

```
TAVideoServer::Client.generate_url("test.webm")
```

This will generate a url poiting to the video on your server with the
name test.webm. 

This token will expire after 3 mins at which point you will get a 403
response code. 

To Run the server simply 
``` bundle exec token_auth_video_server ``` 

#Configuration
You can set the host that you want to use for the url generated by the
client library.

``` TAVideoServer::Client.host = "http://example.com" ```

By default the server will look for video files in a directory called
videos relative to the directory where server is started. 

If you want to customize the root path for videos simple set an ENV
variable

```ENV["VIDEO_SERVICE_ROOT"] = "/SomeUser/media" ```
